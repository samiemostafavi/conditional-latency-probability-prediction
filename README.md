# conditional-latency-probability-prodiction

Implementation of two conditional density estimation methods with parametric neural networks in Python:

* Conventional Mixture Density Network with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
* Novel Mixture Density Network with Gaussian and Extreme Value Mixture Model (EMM)

To use the code, create a 3.6 Python virtual environment in `latency_prediction` folder and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This implementation is based on the repository [here](https://github.com/freelunchtheorem/Conditional_Density_Estimation).
