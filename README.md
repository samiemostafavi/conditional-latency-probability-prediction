# Pr3D - PreDicting Delay probability Density

Implementation of two conditional density estimation methods with parametric neural networks in Python using Tensorflow

* Conventional and non-conditional mixture density network with Gaussian mixture model (GaussianMM)
* Novel conventional and non-conditional mixture density network with Gamma and extreme value mixture model (GammaEVM)


# Using the package

    pip install git+https://github.com/samiemostafavi/pr3d.git
